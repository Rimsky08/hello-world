# hello-world
This is my first project! I'm following the GitHub tutorial.

I started learning html, javascript, css, and php a few years ago out of curiosity to learn more about a WordPress website that I had taken over at my job. I have since started coding my own projects out of fun including creating personal and work related projects. I am continuing to learn as much as I possibly can. I find it addicting!
